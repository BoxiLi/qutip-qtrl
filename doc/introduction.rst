The qutip-qtrl package
======================

The qutip-qtrl package used to be a module ``qutip.control`` under `QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) <http://qutip.org/index.html>`_.
From QuTiP 5.0, the community has decided to decrease the size of the core QuTiP package by reducing the external dependencies, in order to simplify maintenance.
Hence a few modules are separated from the core QuTiP and will become QuTiP family packages.
They are still maintained by the QuTiP team but hosted under different repositories in the `QuTiP organization <https://github.com/qutip>`_.

The qutip-qtrl package, QuTiP quantum optimal control, aims at providing advanced tools for the optimal control of quantum devices.
Compared to other libraries for quantum optimal control, qutip-qtrl puts additional emphasis on the physics layer and the interaction with the QuTiP package.
The package offers support for both the CRAB and GRAPE methods.
